# Recursion Project
This recursion project is taken from the App Academy Open - Data Structures and Algorithms course.

In programming, Recursion is when a function calls itself. As we explore recursion it is important to keep in mind all of the previous concepts we learned about functions. All those function concepts will still apply to recursion!
